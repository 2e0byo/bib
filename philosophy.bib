@article{Chang2011,
  abstract =	 {Why do some epistemic objects persist despite
                  undergoing serious changes, while others go extinct
                  in similar situations? Scientists have often been
                  careless in deciding which epistemic objects to
                  retain and which ones to eliminate; historians and
                  philosophers of science have been on the whole much
                  too unreflective in accepting the scientists'
                  decisions in this regard. Through a re-examination
                  of the history of oxygen and phlogiston, I will
                  illustrate the benefits to be gained from
                  challenging and disturbing the commonly accepted
                  continuities and discontinuities in the lives of
                  epistemic objects. I will also outline two key
                  consequences of such re-thinking. First, a fresh
                  view on the (dis)continuities in key epistemic
                  objects is apt to lead to informative revisions in
                  recognized periods and trends in the history of
                  science. Second, recognizing sources of continuity
                  leads to a sympathetic view on extinct objects,
                  which in turn problematizes the common monistic
                  tendency in science and philosophy; this
                  epistemological reorientation allows room for more
                  pluralism in scientific practice itself.},
