#+Title: Bibliography files

This repo contains bibliography files for use with biblatex.

* Formatting

A script, ~format.py~ is provided, which standardises the files.  When used as a
pre-commit hook it tends to keep diffs in order.

* Roadmap

Some more features would be desirable:

- [ ] Detecting subtitles in the title field (normally indicated by ~:~, but other
  punctuation such as ~?~ can be used).
- [ ] Suggesting urls/dois/arks.  This might be a larger task than it looks, and
  might belong in a separate project.
